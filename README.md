Australia real estate

I develop a real estate project (frontend + backend) that is similar to realestate.com but everyone can use it.

To start the backend : npx nodemon start 
Backend technology : 
  + Node and Express JS
  + MongoDB
  + Bcrypt
  + Multer

To start the front end : npm run start
Frontend technology : 
  + React
  + Redux
  + JWT
  + EmailJs

The website is mainly used for tablets and laptop devices.
